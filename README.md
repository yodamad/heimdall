# Heimdall

A CLI to help with your git directories (for now 😉).

Based on the myth of the Nordic God, [Heimdall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdall), the CLI is here to ease with your multiple Git repositories.

The complete documentation can be found on the dedicated [docsite](https://yodamad.github.io/heimdall/) and here is a quick demo of the interactive mode ⤵️
